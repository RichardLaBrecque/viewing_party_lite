        all-time favourite movie! Like Gordie, I was a shy, sensitive boy, who was
        (and am) a writer, and I''ve been told by so many people I have a talent for
        it. Also, I''ve had many friends like Chris, being tough on the outside, while
        sweet on the inside, and I''ve known people like Vern, Teddy and Denny too
        :) Beautiful music, acting and truth about growing up, as relevant today as
        it was in the 80s/50s :) <3","created_at":"2017-07-27T10:17:01.599Z","id":"5979bd9d92514107d10118ed","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:59.512Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5979bd9d92514107d10118ed"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'
